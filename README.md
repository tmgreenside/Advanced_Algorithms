# Advanced Algorithms

These are my implementations of algorithms found online and heard about from
classmates. I'm also working with some that I came across in Gonzaga University
courses. Another benefit for this project is that it gives me practice with the
lldb debugger.

## Sorting
1. Merge sort.
2. Quicksort.

## Othello
This is a recreation of an assignment from a course in Artificial Intelligence.
It will use a best-first search algorithm to make a move in a standard game
of Othello.
